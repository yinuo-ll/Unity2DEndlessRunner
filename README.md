# Unity2DEndlessRunner
2D Endless Runner game developed in Unity. This mini-game was designed as a rewards component for an Android Productivity App. Players will be able to play a round of this game after finishing a study session of at least 25 minutes (as recommended by the Pomodoro Technique). This project was originally created for UofTHacks, and has since been reworked. Android App Timer component is currently being developed. To be resumed when coursework lightens up :)
